# Exactly Once

for message queue system, message is generated from producer to queue and will be consumed by
consumer. there's 3 delivery semantics:
- at least once. (message is delivered once or more)
- at most once. (message is ignored or just once)
- exactly once. (?? it depends on how to define this term, though we expect this is message is only delivered once.)

basically, `exactly-once` is application level guarantee, inside it's implemented by:
- at least once
- retry with idempotent
- transaction support

but, if there's outside system or non-deterministic system, `exactly-once` is not support. for example:
- how to send email exactly once
- if the consumer's result depends on outside system but the result is time sensitive (that is the system is non-deterministic), retry would introduce in incorrect result
