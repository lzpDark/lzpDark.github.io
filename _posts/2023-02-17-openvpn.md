OpenVPN just not work on my pc, win10 machine.



ping bing.com  failed

ping ${openvpn-server-ip}   ok





I don't know what happens...



reset network setting, restart pc, connect OpenVPN, works. (what a shame)

not work again..

reset server os, reinstall openvpn, now works using new .ovpn file
